      In Next.js 12, we began our transition to native Rust-powered tooling. We
      started by migrating away from Babel, which resulted in 17x faster
      transpilation. Then, we replaced Terser, which resulted in 6x faster
      minification. It's time to go all-in on native for bundling. Using the
